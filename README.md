# Ahrify-raylib

A reworked of Ahrify player, i made it for web and one for desktop with electron, since then i still think that i need to rewrite it in an appropriate desktop language like c/c++. I did try several project in QT platfornm, but QT still restrict me in someway and the retain UI mode is old and verry hassle to work with. I'm testing with raylib and will move to some network lib.
